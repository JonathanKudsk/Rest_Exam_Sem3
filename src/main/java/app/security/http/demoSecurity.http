### ============================================
### Tests for removeRole and deleteUser
### ============================================

### Create a test user to delete (for testing purposes)
POST {{url}}/auth/register

{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "test123"
}

### Create another test user (for testing removeRole from different user)
POST {{url}}/auth/register

{
    "username": "testadmin",
    "password": "test123"
}


### Add a role to current user (manager role) so we can test removing it
POST {{url}}/auth/user/role
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "role": "manager"
}

### Add manager role to testuser so we can test removing it
POST {{url}}/auth/user/role
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "role": "manager"
}

### Test: Remove role from testuser (admin can remove role from any user)
DELETE {{url}}/auth/user/role
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "username": "testuser",
    "role": "manager"
}

### Test: Remove role from current user (admin can remove role from themselves too)
DELETE {{url}}/auth/user/role
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "username": "user",
    "role": "manager"
}

### Test: Try to remove a role that doesn't exist (should handle gracefully)
DELETE {{url}}/auth/user/role
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "username": "testuser",
    "role": "nonexistentrole"
}

### Test: Delete testuser
DELETE {{url}}/auth/user
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "username": "testuser"
}

### Test: Try to delete a user that doesn't exist (should return 404)
DELETE {{url}}/auth/user
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "username": "nonexistentuser"
}

### Test: Delete yourself (admin can delete their own account)
DELETE {{url}}/auth/user
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{jwt_token}}

{
    "username": "user"
}

### Verify testuser is deleted - try to login (should fail)
POST {{url}}/auth/login

{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "test123"
}

### Clean up: Delete testadmin
